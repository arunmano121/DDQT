**Defect Detection and Quantification Toolbox (DDQT)**

Arun Manohar (2021)

The main goals of this Python toolbox are:

* Reading in Matlab data
* Visualizing data
* Creating features in the time and spatial domain
* Feature reduction using PCA
* Identifying defects using Mahalanobis distance and Outlier Forest
* Quantifying results using ROC curves
* Visualizing outcomes

There are numerous avenues to enhance this toolbox. I welcome any
contributions to this program. Some possible areas that could use
improvements are:

* Improvements in feature space
* Improvements to defect detection algorithms
* Coding enhancements

Feel free to fork and add any enhancements, and let me know if a pull request
is needed to merge the changes.
